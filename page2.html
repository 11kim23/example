      <p>
        I found my kitties about a month ago (May 8) in my garage. At first, I only saw one but when we returned the next day I found two more! I had been wanting a kitty for the past two months prior because my senior cat went missing... But thankfully God gave me three kittens instead of one :) I also got a yellow kittie that reminds me of my old cat. </p>
