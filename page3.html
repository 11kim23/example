      I've had one of my dos since I was 5 and since then he has been my best friend. My neighbors later gave me another dog that they thought was my dog's son. I've had him since I was 8 and he is a handful! With plenty of energy! Although I can't lie... I'm scared that any day when I go feed them I'm going to find my elderly dog dead.... it's terrifying. But I'm glad I go to share so many beautiful memories with him! </p>
